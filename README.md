# Sign Language Recognition ‚òùÔ∏èü§ûü´≥ü§üüëã

## Introduction

Sign Language Recognition is a repository that develops machine learning models and systems for recognizing and interpreting sign language gestures. This project aims to bridge the communication gap between individuals who use sign language as their primary means of communication and those who do not understand it.

## Features

- Dataset collection: Dataset contains a collection of 30,192 images. This dataset can be accessed through the following URL: [ASL(American Sign Language) Alphabet Dataset | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/debashishsau/aslamerican-sign-language-aplhabet-dataset).

- Model development:
  - Machine learning models: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Deep learning models: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Artificial neural networks (ANNs).
- Training and evaluation
- Real-time recognition: The trained models can be deployed in real-time applications to recognize sign language gestures captured by devices such as webcams.
